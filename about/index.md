I am Ronny Cravioto-Ross, a first year student at UBC's Applied Science program. In my free time, I love to explore my interests, learn about new topics, and apply what I learn while doing projects and creating things.

## Interests
From rocket motors to electrolysis cells to music and harmony, my interests span many fields and disciplines, and I'm not yet sure what I would like to become an expert in. Some general categories of interest of mine are:

- Mathematics
- Music (Jazz is cool :D)
- Chemistry
- Rocket propulsion
- Computer Programming
- Electronic Circuits (specifically high power / high voltage hehe)


<h2 id="about-being-half-deaf">About Being Half Deaf</h2>
On March 1st 2023, towards the end of my final year of high school, I woke up with extreme dizzyness, and an inability to hear from my right ear. I went to the hospital, and I was diagnosed eith sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Throughout the next months, I got steriod shots through my eardrum, and spent many hours in a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber, all while studying for my IB exams.

The treatments did little to help, and while my hearing on my right side has improved from literally nothing to a very small amount, it remains functionally useless for most applications.

I am quite grateful and lucky that the hearing on my left side is excellent; this way, there has only been a limited impact on my day to day life. One of the most profound impacts has been that I can no longer tell where sounds come from, so for example when someone calls my name, or I hear a car coming down the road as I'm walking down the sidewalk, or my parents call me from another room, I have to start looking in all directions to figure out where I'm hearing things from.

Another impact, which was more of a surprise, and somewhat more interesting, is that my ability to pick sounds apart from background noise has greatly diminished. When I'm in a quiet room, I have no trouble understanding a friend whispering, but if I'm in a noisy restaurant, or in the car with music playing, I struggle disproportionaltely more to understand.

This effect is more intriguing, as it seems to suggest our brains use the stereo input from both ears to not only pick apart which direction sound comes from, but also to focus in on specific sounds and isolate them from background noise.

If you're interested more in my hearing, and in how I plan to fix my inability to tell which direction sound comes from, check out my project [WaveTrace](/projects/wavetrace).
