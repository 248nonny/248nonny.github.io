# About Me

---

I am Ronny Cravioto-Ross, a first year student at UBC's Applied Science program. In my free time, I love to explore my interests, learn about new topics, and apply what I learn in the process of doing projects and creating things.

Some of my interests are
- Mathematics
- Music
- Chemistry
- Computer Programming
- Electronic Circuits (specifically high power / high voltage hehe)

# Blogroll

While most of these are not in fact blogs, here are some websites and content creators that I'm a huge fan of:
## <a href="https://www.xkcd.com" target="_blank">xkcd</a>

(Fun fact: [this](https://xkcd.com/1356/) is where I learned about kerbal space program)

This webcomic is arguably my favourite source of comedy; while it is generally rather esoteric, you either learn something in the process of figuring out a joke, or you get a rush of wittiness from understanding a comic on the spot.

## <a href="https://www.youtube.com/styropyro" target="_blank">Styropyro</a>

The projects documented on this youtube channel are absurdly crazy and awesome; Drake (the owner of the account) is my idol both because I love the projects he makes, and I admire the fearlessness (... or is it lack of self preserverance?) that he has towards all things lethal.

<!-- ## [ElectroBOOM](https://www.youtube.com/electroboom) -->
## <a href="https://www.youtube.com/electroboom" target="_blank">ElectroBOOM</a>
<a href="https://www.electroboom.com" target="_blank">link to his website</a>

This YouTube channel has many rather informative and useful videos, while also profiding comic relief through (un?) intentional electric shock.

## <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/explosionsfire2" target="_blank">Explosions and Fire</a>

Do you think chemistry is cool? Do you like explosions and/or fire? (for me the answer is "yes" to both!) Then this YouTube account is for you! Watch as Tom, a chemist in Australia, makes crazy cool molecules (that happen to violently explode). See also the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ExtractionsAndIre" target="_blank">companion account</a> which details the processes behind the scenes in more detail.

# About This Site

I created this website to share my thoughts, projects, and doings in general with the world at large. This site was created with <a href="https://www.jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, and is hosted on Github Pages. The font used throughout the site is [Computer Modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern), my favourite font, created originally for [$$ LaTeX $$](https://www.latex-project.org/), so a huge thank you to those who worked on that (just because it's a really cool platform with a really cool font hehe). I originally copied the default 'minima' theme that comes with Jekyll before restyling and adding extra functionality myself.
