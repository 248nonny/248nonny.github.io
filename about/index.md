I am Ronny Cravioto-Ross, a first year student at UBC's Applied Science program. In my free time, I love to explore my interests, learn about new topics, and apply what I learn in the process of doing projects and creating things.

Some of my interests are
- Mathematics
- Music
- Chemistry
- Computer Programming
- Electronic Circuits (specifically high power / high voltage hehe)
