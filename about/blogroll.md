While most of these are not in fact blogs, here are some websites and content creators that I'm a huge fan of:
## <a href="https://www.xkcd.com" target="_blank">xkcd</a>

(Fun fact: [this](https://xkcd.com/1356/) is where I learned about kerbal space program)

This webcomic is arguably my favourite source of comedy; while it is generally rather esoteric, you either learn something in the process of figuring out a joke, or you get a rush of wittiness from understanding a comic on the spot.

## <a href="https://www.youtube.com/styropyro" target="_blank">Styropyro</a>

The projects documented on this youtube channel are absurdly crazy and awesome; Drake (the owner of the account) is my idol both because I love the projects he makes, and I admire the fearlessness (... or is it lack of self preserverance?) that he has towards all things lethal.

<!-- ## [ElectroBOOM](https://www.youtube.com/electroboom) -->
## <a href="https://www.youtube.com/electroboom" target="_blank">ElectroBOOM</a>
<a href="https://www.electroboom.com" target="_blank">link to his website</a>

This YouTube channel has many rather informative and useful videos, while also profiding comic relief through (un?) intentional electric shock.

## <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/explosionsfire2" target="_blank">Explosions and Fire</a>

Do you think chemistry is cool? Do you like explosions and/or fire? (for me the answer is "yes" to both!) Then this YouTube account is for you! Watch as Tom, a chemist in Australia, makes crazy cool molecules (that happen to violently explode). See also the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ExtractionsAndIre" target="_blank">companion account</a> which details the processes behind the scenes in more detail.
