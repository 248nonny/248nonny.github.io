I created this website to share my thoughts, projects, and doings in general with the world at large. This site was created with <a href="https://www.jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, and is hosted on Github Pages. The font used throughout the site is [Computer Modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern), my favourite font, created originally for [$$ \LaTeX $$](https://www.latex-project.org/), so a huge thank you to those who worked on that (just because it's a really cool platform with a really cool font hehe). I originally copied the default 'minima' theme that comes with Jekyll before restyling and adding extra functionality myself.
