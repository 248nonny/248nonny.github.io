  This is one of the best pictures that resulted from this project. Something I really like about this one is
  how the arc appears to be emanating from the copper acetate crystal on the left.

  Another one of the top 3 pictures from this project. I belive this one had a different white balance setting,
  hence the colors are somewhat warmer. This one makes me imagine a nebula of some sort, and I like the blue aura
  around the left electrode.
