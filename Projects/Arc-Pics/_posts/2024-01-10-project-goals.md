This project is a continuation of the legacy arc pics project. Recently, I got my hands on a low end macro lens, and I figured it would be cool to get some pictures of the arcs from closer up, mainly so the pictures would have a higher resolution.

I dug through my lab to look for the two high voltage magic black boxes that I had, but when I found them and tested them, neither of them worked :(

This was not ideal, but after some thinking, I came up with a better idea: I have a flyback transformer from an old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube" target="_blank">CRT TV</a> that is in working condition, and the though occurred to me that an alternative to a high end macro lens (the one I have in all honesty would not be much of an improvement over the old picture) would be to simply make the electric arcs bigger (muahahahahahaaa).

So. This project will not only (if all goes well) result in some amazing pictures of colorful electric arcs, but it will also involve building a driver for the flyback transformer, as well as some DIY capacitors (unless I can find some) that I'll use to create substantially larger and more powerful arcs (sounds like lots of fun to me!).
