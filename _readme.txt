This is for my own reference, so I don't forget important things :D


For creating a project, make a .md file in _projects. this may have the attributes:

- name
    -> the name of the project
- layout
    -> this should be "project page"
- status
    -> "Ongoing" - the project is in progress.
    -> "Complete" - the project has been completed.
    -> "Legacy" - the project was completed before the creation of the site, and has minimal posts as a result.
    -> "Abandoned" - hopefully you never use this lol.
- start date
    -> in format "Month Year", e.g. "June 2023".
- end date
    -> like start date, but only include if "Complete" or "Abandoned".
- description
    -> a semi-detailed description including goals and why you're doing it.
        this will be the main text displayed on the project's page.
- short_description
    -> a shortened description for quickly describing the project in other pages.
- gallery
    -> true/false - if true then a gallery must exist / be created for this project.
- importance
    -> a string that projects will be sorted with in alphabetical order
    -> e.g. "aaa" is placed before "bbb".
- github_repo
    -> the name of github repo, assumed to be under my username (do I use "my" or "our"
        or "your" when addressing myself?)
    -> a link to this will be provided.
