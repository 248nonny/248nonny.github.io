This is the first blog post I'm writing with jekyll :D Hooray hooray hooray!!

([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is the platform I used to build this site.)

Progress is being made. Yesterday I finished the [jekyll getting started tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/), and today I'm going to figure out how to make the page look nicer, as currently we're rocking the default style-less HTML look:
<img src="/assets/images/2023-12-29-Original-State-Screenshot.png" alt="how the website looked after completing the tutorial." style="width: 20cm">

I copied over the default Jekyll theme files (everything in the _layouts, _sass, and _includes directories for those who are familiar with Jekyll), which make the site look like this:

<img src="/assets/images/2023-12-29-Theme-State-Screenshot.png" alt="how the website looked after applying the default jekyll theme." style="width: 20cm">

I edited the default color scheme and made some more changes to the theme, resulting in the website you see now. I also added my favourite font, Computer Modern, which is used in $$ \LaTeX $$, by following [this guide](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_fonts.asp).

This is what the website looks like after these changes:

<img src="/assets/images/2023-12-29-Theme-Customized-State-Screenshot.png" alt="how the website looked after I customized the color scheme and font to my liking." style="width: 20cm">

Now that's more like it!

(Note that I also added the code from [this forum post](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/how-to-use-latex-on-jekyll/4119/2) in order to render the above LaTeX logo, and to enable support for math equations throughout my posts. Also, I took the above picture after making other changes to the site's structure, hence the new menu items.)
