This is the first blog post I'm writing with jekyll :D Hooray hooray hooray!!

Progress is being made. Currently, I'm about to finish the official [jekyll getting started tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/). Next up I've gotta figure out how to make the page look nicer; currently we're rocking the default style-less html look:

<img src="/assets/images/2023-12-28-current-website-look.png" alt="how the website looks at the time of posting." style="width: 20cm">

Hopefully anyone reading this sees a more refined looking site; If you don't, then future me has some work to do.
