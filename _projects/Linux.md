description: A collection of scripts, hacks, workarounds, and other things that I use on my Linux running laptop.

When I got my new laptop in late 2023, I decided to put dual boot Windows 11 and Arch Linux on it. My old laptop had been running only Arch, but I was missing out on using some non-[wineable](https://www.winehq.org/) software (e.g. Solidworks, ANSYS), so I decided dual boot would be best moving forwards.

This is not so much a standalone project as it is a collection of scripts, hacks, workarounds, and how-tos related to my new laptop and GNU/Linux in general.
