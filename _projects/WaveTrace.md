On March 1st 2023, I woke up with no hearing in my right ear, due to a condition called (as I later found out) Sudden Neurosensory Hearing Loss.

This loss of hearing has had various effects on my day to day life; one of the most pronounced effects being unable to figure out which direction sound comes from, as my brain no longer has access to stereo sound input.

This project aims to provide a way to detect in [which direction sound is coming from for multiple sources of sound at once](/projects/wavetrace/2024/how-it-will-work/), with the ultimate goal of creating a software library that can be used for further applications. On a longer time scale, one such further application that I'd like to pursue is [real time AI driven directional subtitles](/projects/wavetrace/2024/ultimate-goal-subtitles/), which would allow me and other people suffering from partial and total deafness to understand conversations and perceive the world around them better.
