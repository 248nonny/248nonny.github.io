In 2022, my high school organized a school wide science photo contest, where each submission was judged based on how well it demonstrates a scientific concept or phenomenon, as well as the photographic composition of the photo.

I decided I wanted to take some pictures of electric arcs, and adding some metal salts and experimenting with photographic techniques (see below posts for details), I ended up winning the contest with the following picture:

More pictures from this photoshoot are available in the project gallery, as well as a video showing my photoshoot setup.
